  <h1>How the Headset Works</h1>

  <p>
    The headset leverages advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to
    detect neural signals and translate them into actionable commands. It uses a
    combination of sensors, machine learning algorithms, and real-time data
    processing to enable seamless interaction between the user and devices. This
    cutting-edge technology opens up possibilities in areas such as augmented
    reality, robotics, and accessibility.
